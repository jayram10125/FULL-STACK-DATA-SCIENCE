    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Being a general-purpose language, it can be used to build almost any type of application with the right tools/libraries. Additionally, python supports objects, modules, threads, exception-handling, and automatic memory management which help in modelling real-world problems and building applications to solve these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of using Python:**\n",
    "- Python is a general-purpose programming language that has a simple, easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, is completely open-source, and supports third-party packages encouraging modularity and code reuse.\n",

    "### **`2. What is a dynamically typed language?`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we understand a dynamically typed language, we should learn about what typing is. **Typing** refers to type-checking in programming languages. In a **strongly-typed** language, such as Python, **\"1\" + 2** will result in a type error since these languages don't allow for \"type-coercion\" (implicit conversion of data types). On the other hand, a **weakly-typed** language, such as Javascript, will simply output **\"12\"** as result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type-checking can be done at two stages:\n",
    "- **Static -** Data Types are checked before execution.\n",
    "- **Dynamic -** Data Types are checked during execution.\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, executes each statement line by line and thus type-checking is done on the fly, during execution. Hence, Python is a Dynamically Typed Language.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are several built-in data types in Python. Although, Python doesn't require data types to be defined explicitly during variable declarations type errors are likely to occur if the knowledge of data types and their compatibility with each other are neglected. Python provides `type()` and `isinstance()` functions to check the type of these variables. These data types can be grouped into the following categories-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **None Type:** **None** keywork represents the null values in Python. Boolean equality operation can be performed using these NoneType objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Numeric Type:** There are three distinct numeric types - `integers`, `floating-point numbers` and `complex numbers`. Additionally, `booleans` are a sub-type of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sequence Types:** According to Python Docs, there are three basic Sequence Types - `lists`, `tuples`, and `range` objects. Sequence types have the `in` and `not in` operators defined for their traversing their elements. These operators share the same priority as the comparison operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mapping Types:** A mapping object can map hashable values to random objects in Python. Mappings objects are mutable and there is currently only one standard mapping type, the `dictionary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Set Types:** Currently, Python has two built-in set types - `set` and `frozenset`. `set` type is mutable and supports methods like *add()* and *remove()*. `frozenset` type is immutable and can't be modified after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Callable Types:** Callable types are the types to which function call can be applied. They can be **user-defined functions, instance methods, generator functions**, and some other **built-in functions, methods** and **classes**.\n",
    "Refer to the documentation at [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html) for a detailed view of the callable types.\n"

    "\n",
    "* A **package** is a collection of related modules that work together to provide certain functionality. These modules are contained within a folder and can be imported just like any other modules. This folder will often contain a special `__init__` file that tells Python it’s a package, potentially containing more modules nested within subfolders\n",

Matplotlib is a plotting library. The Python Standard Library contains hundreds of modules for performing common tasks, like sending emails or reading JSON data. What’s special about the Standard Library is that it comes bundled with your installation of Python, so you can use its modules without having to download them from anywhere.\n",
